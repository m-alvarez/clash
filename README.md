clash
=====

A silly thing for doing Markov mashups of texts.

Disclaimer
----------
I'm entirely new to Go, this being my second non-trivial (>100 loc) application. Therefore I welcome any and all feedback with open arms!

How to use it
-------------
Just build the executble and run ./clash file1 file2 n
where n is the maximum number of sentences you want to generate. For a very lax definition of sentence.

How does it work?
-----------------
Poorly.
